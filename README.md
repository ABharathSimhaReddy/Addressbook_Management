# Addressbook_Management
The Address Book project is a simple contact management system that lets users add, view, search, update, and delete contact details like name, phone, email, and address. Built using concepts like arrays, structures, and file handling, it helps in learning data storage, retrieval, and real-world application development.


1. 📒 Address Book Management System  

The Address Book Management System is a simple project developed in C language.  
It allows users to manage contact details in an easy and efficient way through a console-based interface.  
The system uses file handling in C to store all contacts permanently, so that data is not lost when the program is closed.  

📌 This project is useful for understanding concepts of  
-> C programming  
->File handling (reading and writing data into files)  
->Structures in C  
->Modular programming  
->Menu driven program design  

2. ✨ Features  

->➕ Add new contacts with details such as Name, Phone Number, Email, and Address  
->📋 View all saved contacts in a structured format  
->🔍 Search for contacts by Name or Phone Number  
->✏️ Update the details of existing contacts  
->🗑️ Delete a contact from the address book  
->💾 Store contacts permanently in a file so they are available even after the program is closed  

3. 💻 How the System Works  

1. The program displays a main menu with different options  
2. The user selects an option such as Add, View, Search, Update, or Delete  
3. Based on the choice, the program executes the required function  
4. All data is saved in a file called contacts.dat for future use  

4. 🎯 Educational Value  

This project is mainly created for learning purposes. It helps beginners in C programming to:  
-> Practice file operations like fopen, fwrite, fread, and fclose  
->Understand how to use structures to store multiple fields for a contact  
->Learn modular programming by separating code into multiple files  
->Gain experience in building real-life applications using C
